            Welcome to the Demo of my <a href="https://github.com/bryang229/radar">Radar project</a>.<br>
            My radar project originally used 4 SD04 Ultrasonic sensors to approximate distances of nearby objects. When
            arranged properly it has a sudo radar effect. When the sensor detects something the arduino will draw the
            object as a dot and the position on the LED matrix would depend on the distance of the object. </p>
        <h3> <b>How to use demo:</b> </h3>
        <p>
            <b>Detection:</b>
            The above LED Matrix can sense your mouse (when you tap if on a phone) within the grid around the
            matrix. <br/>
            <b>The Grid:</b>
            The grid represents the field of range that the SD04 sensors had. You can change their sensitivity by changing the LED size (see <b>Change Size</b>)<br/>
            <b>Showing/Hiding Grid:</b> 
            You can hide/show the grid using
            the Show Grid button below the demo.<br />
            <b>Change Size:</b>
            The Slider right next to the Show Grid button allows you to vary the size of the LED Matrix which also
            increases the size of the grid. <br />
            <b>Move:</b>
            You can also move the LED Matrix using your keyboard <br />
